# PathoLM-dupe
inspired by techniques used in PathoLM paper, P"athoLM: Identifying pathogenicity from the DNA sequence through the Genome Foundation Model"

i wanted to run the pathoLM model on my own but because the paper is a preprint and under review process, the authors haven't open sourced the code + model infrastructure. So I decided to make my own replica of it based on the contents in the paper.
